HTTP client

Submitted File: client.c
Description: the file contains 7 functions in addition to the main, the program receives a request through main args,
parses the request, makes a socket, connects to the server of the host, send request and reads the response.

Notes: the parsing functions covered as much edge cases as could. according to lecturer's guidelines, we shouldn't cover every letter error.
in clion (3.2022) there are a warnings, in fact it's not. I assume that you compile and run in the command line.
